## Things to know before diving in

### Notes about used terminology:

-   Arguments that are optional all have the `: Optional` suffix. Every other argument is required.
-   **User** refers to any Discord User, **Member** refers to a Server Member that has to be on the same Server as where this Command is used in.
-   Currently the only prefix for the message commands is `%`. When using slash commands you need to use `/`, the vast majority of Commands can be used in both ways.
-   **Slash version unavailable** means that you can only use the message-command version with the shown prefix. This is either due to a discord limitation or a deliberate design choice.  
    Every other command will be available as both a message- and slash-command.
-   **Aliases** show you other names the Command is available under. The usage is exactly the same if you use the default name or one of the listed aliases. Note that these only work when using message-commands, there are no aliases for the slash-command versions.

### Notes about required permissions:

-   **Moderator only** means that you have to be the Server Owner, have Administrator Rights or the Moderator Role to use this Command. These commands only work within approved Guilds.
-   **Admin only** means that you need to have Administrator Rights in order to use this Command.
-   **Owner only** means that only the Bot's Owner can use this Command.
